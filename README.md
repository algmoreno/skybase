WeatherView 

This app is designed to show the weather conditions for any city.

When the user types in a city in the search field, the temperature, humidity,
wind speed and UV index will appear, as well as a 5-day forecast for that city. 
The user can click on any of the previously searched cities and render those 
respective results.
